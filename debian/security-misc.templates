_Description: Manual intervention may be required for permission-hardener update
 No panic. Nothing is broken. Just some rare condition has been hit.
 permission-hardener is being updated to correct a minor bug that caused
 permission-hardener state file corruption. If you installed your own custom
 permission-hardener configuration, some manual intervention may be required.
