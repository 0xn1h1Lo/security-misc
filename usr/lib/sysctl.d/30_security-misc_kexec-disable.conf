## NOTE:
## This configuration is in a dedicated file because the ram-wipe package
## requires kexec. However, ram-wipe cannot ship a config file
## /etc/sysctl.d/40_ram-wipe.conf that sets 'kernel.kexec_load_disabled=0'.
## Once systemd-sysctl.service has set 'kernel.kexec_load_disabled=1',
## it cannot be undone without a reboot. This is an upstream Linux security feature.

## Disables kexec, which can be used to replace the running kernel.
## Kexec is useful for live kernel patching without rebooting.
